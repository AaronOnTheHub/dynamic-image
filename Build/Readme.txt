This build file was originally designed to be run from within TeamCity,
but it can also be run from the Visual Studio Command Prompt.

It will generate the DLL files. It will also generate a CHM file, but only
if you have Sandcastle installed. Sandcastle takes up 385Mb of space so
it's not feasible to include it in the repository.
